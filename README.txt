SQL Project - Queries on World Population Data Part 2

This project revolved around using different tables in the SQLite Database and to get used to using commands to join tables and grouping data to provide cleaner output.

The data involves two tables:
- population_years, which contains data on the population of different Country Ids during the period of 2000 to 2010
- countries, which contains the names of countries and the continents each of the countries are located in.

Using the two tables together the following questions were answered:
1) How many entries in the database are from Africa?
2) What was the total population of Oceania in 2005?
3) What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
4) What country had the smallest population in 2007?
5) What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by the dataset?
6) How many countries have the word "The" in their name?
7) What was the total population of each continent in 2010?

Answers Obtained:
1) 616 entries (56 Countries in Africa for 11 years each)
2) 32.66 million
3) 25.89 million
4) Niue with 0.00216 million
5) 38.56 million
